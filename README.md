# two-oscillator-model
The Poincaredt_behfb function contains the code of a Poincare model which is entrained to the external light-dark cycle and receives feedback from physical activity. 

With Poincare_behfb_1osc a sigle-oscillator model can be runned. 
With Poincare_behfb_2osc a two-oscillator model can be runned. Set the parameters to change the network configuration of the model.
